# CronWatch ‚è±Ô∏è

**Never guess if your cron jobs are running again. CronWatch is a simple, affordable, yet powerful monitoring service for your scheduled tasks, background jobs, and microservices.**

It provides the peace of mind that your critical automations are working as expected. If they don't, you'll be the first to know.

## The Problem: "Silent Failures"

You have a critical cron job that backs up your database every night at 3 AM. You set it up and hope for the best. But what happens if:
- The script crashes due to an unexpected error?
- The server reboots at 2:59 AM?
- The job silently hangs and never finishes?

You won't know until it's too late. **CronWatch solves this by turning your jobs from a "black box" into a transparent, monitored process.**

---

## How It Works

It's incredibly simple:

1.  **Create a Check:** In the CronWatch UI, you create a new check (e.g., "Daily DB Backup") and set its schedule (e.g., `every 24 hours`).
2.  **Get a URL:** We generate a unique URL for your check.
3.  **Wrap Your Job:** You add a simple `curl` command to the end of your cron job. This "pings" our service to let us know it finished successfully.

**Before:**
```bash
0 3 * * * /path/to/backup.sh
After:
code
Bash
0 3 * * * /path/to/backup.sh && curl https://your.cronwatch.instance/ping/abc-123```

If we don't receive the ping on time, we immediately alert you via Email, Slack, or Telegram.
